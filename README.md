# React Loosely Lazy App 

A simple react app that comsumes [`react-loosely-lazy-component`](https://github.com/rohan-deshpande/react-loosely-lazy-component) to test out if integration with external dependencies that use [`react-loosely-lazy`](https://github.com/atlassian-labs/react-loosely-lazy) internally will work as expected and also get picked up by the webpack plugin.
